## About the Plan of St. Gall

The Plan of St. Gall is one of the most ancient architectural drawings that have survived to this day, originating from around the 9th century. It represents a monastic compound, including churches, houses, stables, kitchens, workshops, brewery, infirmary, and even a special house for bloodletting. Historically, it provides invaluable insights into the organization and the architectural ideals of medieval monastic life.
