![Annotated Plan of St. Gall](https://github.com/Dr-Hutchinson/st.gall_visualization/blob/main/annotated_gall_plan.png)

## Overview

This repository contains a Streamlit application designed to visualize the Plan of St. Gall, an important architectural diagram from medieval Europe. The application uses Plotly and Streamlit for rendering the plan and associated content. Historical images are drawn from medieval manuscript collections while accompanying illustrations were made image synthesis models like DALL-E 3 and Midjourney.

## About the Plan of St. Gall

The [Plan of St. Gall](https://digital.library.ucla.edu/catalog/ark:/21198/zz002kp2b7) is one of the most ancient architectural drawings that have survived to this day, originating from around the ninth century AD. It represents a monastic compound, including churches, houses, stables, kitchens, workshops, brewery, infirmary, and even a special house for bloodletting. Historically, it provides invaluable insights into the organization and the architectural ideals of medieval monastic life.
